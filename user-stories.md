    Scrum masters are responsible for:

Leading and improving internal processes necessary for Scrum teams to complete their work

Helping the team prepare for and successfully execute sprints, so developers can focus on their work instead of more logistical tasks

Facilitating planning meetings, daily standups, and sprint retrospectives 

Removing roadblocks for developers and keeping everyone aligned with Scrum framework principles

On the other hand, the product owner role has a more external focus than the Scrum master. Instead of leading team processes, they’re more focused on the product itself—specifically how to create the best possible product for end users. 

Product owners are in charge of:

Incorporating feedback from stakeholders and end users

Translating that feedback into specific product features and backlog items for the Scrum team to work on
