    Scenario 1: Finding and Reviewing a Book

        Actor: Ingrid, a registered user.

        Goal: Ingrid just finished reading "Naiv. Super." by Erlend Loe and wants to write a review for it.

        Steps:

            Ingrid opens the application/website.

            She logs in using her username and password.

            She uses the search bar at the top and types "Naiv Super".

            A list of results appears. She clicks on the entry for "Naiv. Super." by Erlend Loe.

            She lands on the book's detail page, seeing the cover, synopsis, and existing reviews.

            She scrolls down to the "Write a Review" section.

            She types her thoughts about the book into the text box (e.g., "A charming and thought-provoking read about finding meaning in simplicity...").

            (If applicable) She selects a star rating (e.g., 4 out of 5 stars).

            She clicks the "Submit Review" button.

            The page refreshes (or updates dynamically), and her review now appears in the list of reviews for "Naiv. Super.".

            Later, she navigates to her profile page and sees "Naiv. Super." listed under her reviewed books.

            He searches up Gard.

            He clicks on Gard's profile.

            The webpage provides only the non-personal related information

            Gard enters the webpage, not logged in.

            He searches up "Sult" by Knut Hamsun.

            He clicks on the book from the suggestions list.

            He writes a scummy and meaningless text into the review and gives it 0 stars.

            The webpage prompts him to log in/sign up to be able to post the review.

            Noting anti-spam measures, Gard leaves the website, hopefully having learned a lesson.
