1. Understanding the Core Features:

    Book Database: Contains information on millions of books (title, author, ISBN, description).

    User Profiles: Users can register, log in, and have a profile page.

    Reviews: Users can write reviews for books. Reviews are linked to both the user's profile and the specific book page.

    Book Pages: Each book has a page displaying its details and associated reviews.

    National Library Link: A button/link on each book page redirects the user to a search results page on the National Norwegian Library website for that specific book.



2. Identifying the Primary User Role:

    Reader/User: This is the main actor interacting with the system. They browse books, read reviews, write their own reviews, manage their profile, and use the library link.




3. User Stories:

User stories follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action/goal], so that [benefit/reason]."
